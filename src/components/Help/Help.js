          1. After submitting my paint job, why does my resulting GitHub
          contribution graph not look exactly like how I painted it?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
          GitHub occasionally changes their contribution graph color algorithm
          and does not make it public. Therefore, our model can only make a best
          guess on how to color in your contribution graph. For example,
          GitHub's algorithm disregards "outliers" when calculating the
          different shades of green. We have no idea what constituents an
          outlier in their algorithm. Is it the Z-score? Is it 1.5xIQR? Is it
          some form of clustering? Or maybe some combination of all three? We
          have tried to reverse engineer their color algorithm for days to no
          avail. Therefore, our model can only make a best guess on how to color
          in your contribution graph. We do not guarentee that the submitted
          paint job will reflect your contribution graph perfectly, but we will
          try our best.

          2. Why did Paint GitHub explicitly paint today‚Äôs date when I did not
          paint today‚Äôs date?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
          We need to create an explicit repository to carry the commits that
          ‚Äúpaint‚Äù your contribution graph. It is only possible to create a
          repository on the present day. Creating this repository includes 2
          commits: the repository itself, and a the README file to auto
          initialize the branch. These two commits contribute the paint on the
          present day.
        </Typography>
        <Typography
          variant="body2"

          style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "20px" }}

          3. How long does it usually take to paint a contribution graph?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
          It depends on the max number of commits made on single day within the
          last year. Our algorithm spreads out your paint job‚Äôs commits in
          quartiles ‚Äì based on the four shades of green. If the max number of
          commits made on single day within the last year is a high number, the
          paint job will take longer because more commits are needed to
          progressively reach each darker shade of green.
        </Typography>
        <Typography
          variant="body2"

          style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "20px" }}
        >
          4. I don‚Äôt like the finished paint job on my GitHub profile. How can I
          erase the paint?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
          Delete the repository holding all the commits for your paint jobs. In
          general, Paint GitHub will only generate one repository to hold all
          your paint jobs. If you want Paint GitHub to generate a new repository
          for future paint jobs, simply rename the original repository to
          something else.
        </Typography>
        <Typography
          variant="body2"

        >
          5. I cannot create a paint job. The paint job keeps erroring out. What
          should I do?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
          Try signing in and out again. Usually it is because your access token
          has expired and Paint GitHub needs a new one from GitHub to paint on
          your behalf. On very rare occasions, there will be naming conflicts
          when creating repo or paint jobs. Signing out and in usually solves
          most of these issues. Else, feel free to send us feedback.

          variant="body2"

          6. What kind of commits are you making to the generated repository to
          paint my contribution graph?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
          Paint GitHub makes empty commits into the generated repository for any
          given paint job. No files other than the initial README.md are
          created. Yes, there is an --allow-empty flag for the git commit
          command!
        </Typography>
        <Typography
          variant="body2"

          style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "20px" }}

          7. Why can't I paint a square with a lighter shade of green?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom>
          The darker a square, the more commits are made on that given day.
          Forcing a lighter shade of green implies removing commits from that
          given day. If those commits were a part of an important separate
          repository, it would be disastrous to remove those commits and have
          you lose your work. Therefore, Paint GitHub can only paint over your
          contribution graph and not strip anything from it.
